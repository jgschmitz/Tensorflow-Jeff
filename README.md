# TensorFlow Playground 🧠⚡

<img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tf_logo_social.png" alt="TensorFlow Logo" width="400" height="200">

Welcome to my **TensorFlow experiments repo** — a collection of notebooks, models, and code snippets where I tinker with deep learning ideas, test architectures, and explore how far I can push TensorFlow.  

This isn’t a polished framework or a finished product — it’s a **sandbox for learning and prototyping**.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- Example scripts and notebooks for playing with **neural networks**  
- Small experiments with **CNNs, RNNs, and transformers**  
- Utilities for data preprocessing and visualization  
- Random trials, demos, and ideas that may or may not work 😉

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

I built this repo as a personal learning space while working with TensorFlow.  
It’s where I break things, fix them, and (hopefully) learn something in the process.  

If you’re browsing around, feel free to use anything here as inspiration or reference for your own projects.

## 📢 Disclaimer

This is not an official Google project. It’s just me exploring machine learning with TensorFlow. Expect bugs, experiments, and plenty of TODOs.
