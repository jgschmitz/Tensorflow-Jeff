Install Docker: If Docker isn't already installed, you can install it using the following command:

sudo yum install docker -y

Check OS Compatibility: Docker runs on 64-bit OS with kernel version 3.10 or higher. Before proceeding, ensure you are using a compatible system. If needed, install the latest kernel version from Wheezy backports (or your distribution's equivalent). Follow your backport instructions, then reboot your machine and select the latest kernel version.

Install Docker (if not already installed): If Docker is not yet installed, follow the official Docker installation steps for your OS version here.

Install TensorFlow with Docker: Now that Docker is ready, you can install TensorFlow by pulling the official TensorFlow Docker image:

sudo docker run -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow

This will automatically download the necessary dependencies and set up the Docker image (~300 MiB).

Adding Data Persistence: To save data between sessions, mount a host directory to a directory inside the Docker container:

sudo docker run -it -v /host/dir:/docker/dir b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow

This command mounts /host/dir from your local machine to /docker/dir inside the Docker container, enabling data persistence.
Running Programs in the Docker Environment: You can now run TensorFlow programs inside the container. For example, try running a tutorial like plotting the Mandelbrot set.
