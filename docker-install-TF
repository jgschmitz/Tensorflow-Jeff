Here are the steps:
this is assuming DOCKER is already installed!! = )
Docker runs only on 64-bit OS with kernel version 3.10 or higher. So, the first step must be to install the latest kernel available from wheezy backports. Follow the backport instructions
Then reboot the machine selecting the latest kernel version
Follow the docker installation steps
Now, we are all set to install TensorFlow. Simply run
sudo docker run -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
That will pull all the required dependencies and set the docker image (which was about 300MiB to download)
Wouldn’t it be convenient if we could add some data persistance, to save data so that the host could use it? There’s an option for that as well
sudo docker run -it -v /host/dir:/docker/dir b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
Now the /host/dir is mounted to the /docker/dir when the image is run
And that’s it, no need of a virtualbox, which wastes more time and space than to run a docker image
Check an example program from the tutorial, like plotting mandelbrot set
