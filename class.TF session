Session object encapsulates the environment in which Operation objects are executed, and Tensor objects are evaluated.
# TF then DF then CF
# Lets Build a graph.
@1,
a = tf.constant(5.0)
b = tf.constant(6.0)
c = a * b

# Launch the graph in a session layover on screen.
sess = tf.Session()

# Evaluate the tensor `c`.
print(sess.run(c))
