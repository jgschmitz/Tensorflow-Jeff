Runs: Comparing different executions of your model
You may want to visually compare multiple executions of your model; for example, suppose you've changed the hyperparameters and want to see if it's converging faster. TensorBoard enables this through different "runs". When TensorBoard is passed a logdir at startup, it recursively walks the directory tree rooted at logdir looking for subdirectories that contain tfevents data. Every time it encounters such a subdirectory, it loads it as a new run, and the frontend will organize the data accordingly.

Example: here is a well-organized TensorBoard log directory, with two runs, "run1" and "run2".

/some/path/mnist_experiments/
/some/path/mnist_experiments/run1/
/some/path/mnist_experiments/run1/events.out.tfevents.1456525581.name
/some/path/mnist_experiments/run1/events.out.tfevents.1456525585.name
/some/path/mnist_experiments/run2/
/some/path/mnist_experiments/run2/events.out.tfevents.1456525385.name
/tensorboard --logdir /some/path/mnist_experiments
You may also pass a comma separated list of log directories, and TensorBoard will watch each directory. You can also assign names to individual log directories by putting a colon between the name and the path, as in

#tensorboard --logdir name1:/path/to/logs/1,name2:/path/to/logs/2
